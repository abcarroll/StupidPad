# StupidPad++
StupidPad++ is a highly advanced text editor meant for all types of textual editing.  Since it displays all text in black, it can be said that it honestly can syntax highlight *for every known programming language*.

## Highlights
  * _File Open_: Tired of manually editing your lowly editor's memory manually? No more, for StupidPad++ supports direct file opening from your fileystem.  *Wow!*
  * *File Save*: Most programmers are probably used to manually changing the magnetic bits of their disks, but now you can let StupidPad++ handle the bit changes yourself!
  * *File Save As*: In addition, after you've opened a file, __You can even save it as a DIFFERENT filename!__ Holy smokes!

### But wait there's more!

At StupidPad++, we realize programmers get bored.  That's why in our latest release, we've introduced the __Cool Stuff__ menu.  Simply click the __Cool Stuff__ menu and be able to open websites from a predefined list.  **Amazing!**

## Who made this wonderful application?  How long did it take you?

StupidPad++ is the result of over 15 **minutes!** of full-time development and $1.2m of research and development.  StupidPad++ is the brain child of A. B. Carroll, one of the most prolific programmers of the 21st Century.  After the release of StupidPad, many are calling A. B. the "Ellen Musk-Bill Gates-Steve Jobs" of the IDE / Text Editor Insdustry.

## Is it really free?
**Yes!** While you might expect to pay $10,000 or $20,000 for a single-CPU license for such an advanced application, StupidPad++ is actually free and licensed under the MIT License.  While we don't feel such a mind-blowing text editor could be improved further, if you can somehow think of anything, it's even open source!
